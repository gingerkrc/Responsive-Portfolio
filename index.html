        <p>Greetings portfolio viewers! Let me introduce myself and give you a bit of information about me. My name is Ginger Richards Conly. I was born and 
        raised in Boulder, CO and now live in Denver, CO with my husband, two children, and two cats. 
        I attended the University of Colorado at Denver, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Music with a minor in studio arts. </p>
        
        <p>After several years of working in public libraries, I moved to Washington DC and received a Master of Science in Library Science with a specialization in Music Librarianship at Catholic 
        Univeristy of America. </p>
        
        <p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have performed music since I was a child and have played in several
        garage, punk, and indie-pop bands in both Denver and Washington DC. 
        Currently I am building my portfolio as a web developer, which has been allowing me to exercise my analytical skills along with my creativity. </p>
